# Configuration

BB Content Types includes three admin areas:

- **Post Types**
- **Taxonomies**
- **Import/Export**

## Post Types

Configure labels, slugs, visibility, and editor supports. When you save changes, the plugin will flag rewrites for refresh.

## Taxonomies

Create taxonomies and attach them to one or more post types. You can also map taxonomies under a parent path if needed.

## Import/Export

Use the built-in tools to move configurations between environments.

## Rewrites

If you see 404s after changing slugs or structure, use the **Flush rewrites** action.
