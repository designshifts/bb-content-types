# Troubleshooting

## I see 404s after changing slugs

Use the **Flush rewrites** action in the admin UI. This forces WordPress to rebuild rewrite rules.

## A taxonomy is not showing

- Confirm it is attached to the correct post type.
- Check its visibility settings.

## Import failed

Ensure you are importing a file exported from BB Content Types and that the JSON is valid.
